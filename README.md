# OPOD — One Product One District (Madhya Pradesh)

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend demonstrating the OPOD concept for Madhya Pradesh.

Features:
- Fixed top navbar
- Homepage with district previews (initial 6) and "Show More" to reveal all
- Product detail pages using slug routing
- Dummy JSON data in `src/data/products.json`
- Reusable components and Flipkart-like card UI

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Suggestions / Future improvements:
- Add search and filters (by craft, material, district)
- Add admin panel to manage products
- Replace dummy images with real photos and add CDN
- Connect to a backend API and add pagination
